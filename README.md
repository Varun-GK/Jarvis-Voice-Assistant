# Jarvis-Voice-Assistant
This Python code creates a JARVIS voice assistant that activates using a wake word, listens to user commands, and responds with speech. It can tell time/date, open apps and websites, search Google, generate QR codes, take screenshots, play music, and exit safely using a structured main function.
